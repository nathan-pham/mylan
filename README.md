I would just need a home page, bio, press, contact and for all i care they can all be on the same page.

It's for my sister in law's husband, Mylan, who is trying to be a motivational speaker. He wants something simple, modern, and has vibes - have fun with it, think fun. think basketball. think shoes. black and vibrant colors. think sports. think what you would think would make it look best? He's an amazing African-American man who loves shoe culture, sports, fashion, innovation, and creativity.

If you are able to finish this project I will have roughly 20-25 more for you that pay way better, we are just trying to see how hard you'd want to work to make more and be apart of our go -to team.

If you could show us an idea of what you do based off of this (included logo) that would be extra points and we are always happy to TIP!!!

If you don't want to take the time to build a simple template then maybe just show us where u might put things or just tell us via email.
